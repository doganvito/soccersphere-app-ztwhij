Commit your changes regularly with descriptive messages. This allows you to track changes, revert to previous versions if needed, and collaborate with others.\n\n2.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test your application on both iOS and Android emulators/simulators and physical devices. Pay attention to different screen sizes and OS versions.\n\n3.  **Build Configuration:** Configure your app for release. This often involves setting the app name, icon, bundle identifier (iOS), and package name (Android).\n\n4.  **Building the App:** Use Expo to build the application binaries for both iOS (.ipa file) and Android (.apk or .aab file).\n\n5.  **App Store Submission:** Follow the specific guidelines for the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. This includes providing app descriptions, screenshots, privacy policies, and other required metadata.\n\nSince you are using Expo, you can refer to the Expo documentation for detailed instructions on building and submitting your app to the app stores:\n\n*   **Building the app:**  `eas build` command ([https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/))\n*   **Submitting to app stores:**  `eas submit` command ([https://docs.expo.dev/submit/introduction/](https://docs.expo.dev/submit/introduction/))\n\n"}], "timestamp": "2025-09-10T07:36:39Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "kannst du das project hier abspeichern ?
