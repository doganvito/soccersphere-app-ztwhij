You want to build a social mobile app for sports, similar to Twitter, with features for feeds, profiles, search, events, and transfers. A key feature is the ability to search for nearby games based on the user's location.\n\nHere's a plan for the first version of your app:\n\n- **Home Screen:** Display feeds and reels, similar to a simplified Twitter feed.\n- **Profile Screen:** Show user information (Name, Club, Position) and stats (Played Games, Goals, Assists).\n- **Events Screen:** Allow users to post and view game events with details like club, address, and participating teams.\n- **Search:** Enable searching for feeds, reels, videos, and pictures. Also, implement the location-based search for nearby games.\n\nFor the design, let's go with:\n\n- **Colors:** A base color of white, a primary text color of dark gray, and accent colors of blue and green for highlights.\n- **Typography:** Modern, clean fonts like San Francisco or Roboto.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-10T07:30:08.839754"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build this comprehensive social sports app!
